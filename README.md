# üõ†Ô∏è AWS CodeBuild Managed Self-Hosted GitHub Action Runners

AWS CodeBuild now supports **managed self-hosted GitHub Action runners**, allowing you to build powerful CI/CD capabilities right beside your code and quickly implement a full build, test, and deploy pipeline.

## üöÄ Key Features
- Define GitHub Actions steps directly within any phase of a CodeBuild `buildspec.yml` file.
- Use **self-hosted runners** to execute jobs initiated from GitHub.com on systems you deploy and manage.
- Run GitHub Actions workflow jobs natively within AWS infrastructure.

This integration empowers teams to unify their development and delivery workflows, combining the flexibility of GitHub Actions with the scalability and security of AWS services.
